# C++ projects

With every project, I try to progressively learn new aspects of C++, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the language in a fun way.
- Rock Paper Scissors: variables, data types, functions, if/else and conditional statements, for and while loops, the iostream library, and namespaces
- Tic Tac Toe: macros (#define), iterators, classes, objects, methods, vector and matrix manipulation, data type conversion, switch statements, pseudo-random number generators (Mersenne Twister and uniform integer distribution), how to seed PRNG, recursive functions, and the ternary operator
